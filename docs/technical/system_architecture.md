# System Architecture

## Architectural Philosophy and Design Principles

The Azon Network's architecture represents a fundamental departure from traditional distributed systems design. While conventional architectures typically prioritize either decentralization or performance, Azon's architecture achieves both through a novel multi-layered approach that separates concerns while maintaining tight integration between components. This architectural philosophy emerged from the recognition that truly autonomous AI systems require both complete independence in their operation and seamless integration with their environment.
